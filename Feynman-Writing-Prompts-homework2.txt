for loop

In javascript or any language loops plays an important role. Here for loop makes a lot of things simple and i like to say make the task a cake walk if we can 
crack it using for loop. for loops are having three statements( start, stop , step) to execute block of code inside it.
Ex:

function isPrime(num) {
if (num>1){
    for( var i =2; i<num; i++){
        if(num%i === 0){
            return false;
            }
        }
            return true;
           
        }else{
            return false;
        }
   // return true if num is prime.
  // otherwise return false
  // hint: a prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1
  // hint2: you can solve this using a for loop
  // note: 0 and 1 are NOT considered prime numbers
}

isPrime(1);
isPrime(5);

In above code var i = 2(start), i<num(stop), i++(step/increment). for loop make a block of same code to iterate through the loop number of times until it hits
stop condition. In javascripts if we want we can omit the statements but still the for loop behaves same.

Ex: for( var i =2; i<num;) this one also excecutes in javascript even if you omit the statement.


logical operators and NoT(`&&`, `||`, `!`);

logical operators in javascript are used to compare values, variables.I guess we can say that logical operators are work on conditions.

&& -- excecutes if and only if two expressions/values/variables satisfies.
|| -- executes  if either of two expressions/values/variables satisfies.
! -- executes the in such way what ever comes after changes to opposite value. for example true --> false, false-->true. NOT can be to manipulate the flow.

Arrays:

Arrays are a group of identical values/ variables or a mixed collection of both. Arrays are used to store everything inside a one variable.
We can access the values/ items inside it using its properties. We can do many things on a list of array.
We can find the length of an array, select a specific value inside a array using location/ by key ,value pairs, we can push an item into array,pop out an item
from array, join a group of values/items inside a array. We can manipulate an array in different ways to fetch what we except.

Git:
Git is also like a Github with version control on it. It maintains a master copy and every one can make a copy of it and update the master copy up on submitting
request and acceptance from the main team/ contributors.

Github:
Github is like a cloud storage to maintain a copy of your code. Github has repositories which are similar to folders, where can place the common code,
other stuff under single name as a reference. We can share the code with others and add them as a part of the team to work on the same code which helps
the programmers to work remotely.
